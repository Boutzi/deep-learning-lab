## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-deep-learning-project.git
cd my-deep-learning-project
```
```bash
python -m venv env
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```
## Usage
1. Data Preparation
Place your raw data files in the data/raw/ directory.
Preprocess your data using src/data_loader.py (modify according to your data needs).
2. Training the Model
To train the neural network, you can run the train.py script:

```bash
python src/train.py
```
This will:

Load and preprocess the data.
Build the neural network model defined in src/model.py.
Train the model using the configurations in config/config.yaml.
Save the trained model in the saved_models/ directory.
3. Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the trained model on test data, run the evaluate.py script:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```
4. Running Jupyter Notebooks
If you'd like to experiment interactively, you can run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/model-experiments.ipynb
```
## Project Configuration
The training and model configurations can be adjusted in the config/config.yaml file. For example, you can modify:

The number of layers and units in the network.
The activation functions.
The training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
Dependencies
The project uses the following key libraries:

TensorFlow / Keras for building and training the neural network.
NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization.
All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
